# Movie Trailer Website

This script creates a movie trailer website from a JSON file. Created for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Generating the page

Ensure `films.json` exists, is populated, and is valid JSON. (Check using [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com) if needed)

With python installed, run `python entertainment_center.py` to create the website and launch it in your default browser.


## Re-opening the generated page

Once generated, you can reopen the `fresh_tomatoes.html` file in any browser.
